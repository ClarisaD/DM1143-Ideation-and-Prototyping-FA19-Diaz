## Printed Assignment Guidelines

As with all written work, proofread for spelling and grammar. This is where working as a team will come in handy.

Any printed work that you will turn in, should always contain the following:

* Date
* Your first and last name
* Ideation & Prototyping
* Fall 2019
* Diaz

All written assignments should be submitted as a pdf and emailed to Clarisa.


I will primarily be looking at your blog for when and what you post. This is an integral part of your grade.  Student blogs for this class are listed below:
