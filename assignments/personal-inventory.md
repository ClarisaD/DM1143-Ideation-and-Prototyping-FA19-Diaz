## Personal Inventory

Create a personal inventory of at least three objects that you possess which reveal something about you. Use your smart phone or a video camera to record footage of the objects along with audio narration or written commentary. Upload the video to YouTube, Vimeo, or NYU Stream, then embed the video in your process blog.

Once you've created your personal inventory video, watch the videos of at least three of your classmates. On your process blog, post a short response to each. Compare and contrast them with your own, and be sure to include links to your classmates' videos.
