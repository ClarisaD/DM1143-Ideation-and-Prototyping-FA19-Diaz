## Influences and Interests Collage

Create a "mind map" or "concept map" of all of the various inputs in your life.  This should cover the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination. What interests you? Where did it come from? Post your collage to your process blog. 

It may help to start with post-it notes or sketching diagrams that will help you put down your thoughts. Create a visual arrangement of these inputs through clippings or artwork. Arrange them according to importance. The collage may be physically or digitally created.


Some digital tools for making collages include Photoshop, Adobe Spark, Canva, BeFunky, piZap and many more you can find for free online.
