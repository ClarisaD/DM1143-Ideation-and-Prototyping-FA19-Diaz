## Evolution Timeline

As research for your future utopia / dystopia project, create an evolution timeline by making one of the following:

* an infographic as a pdf \(post on your process blog\) **OR** 
* another video documentary 1 to 3 minutes in length, post on vimeo or youtube, and embed on your process blog **OR** 
* an interactive data visualization and embed within your process blog.

The timeline should reflect:

* an object or experience that relates to your framing story or message for your future Dystopia / Utopia project OR
* your favorite object or experience \(if you are having a hard time coming up with ideas for the future dystopia / utopia project\)


* There should be three parts to your timeline: the past, present, and future.  Express this either as an infographic, video, or data visualization.

If you change your object or experience, write a new love letter/break up letter for it.  Post all your process on your blog so I can see.

* Secondly, express your object/experience in the future through 3 different mediums.  These can be rough but they need to be different approaches. You might have an illustration + a video + a physical object or a collage + a piece of music + a performance piece for example.  You have no limit to mediums, show a combination of expressions.  

If you chose an experience, think of that experience in terms of scenarios or simulations.  Where is it?  Who's in it?  What happens one way, if you change something then what happens?

For the object and experience think about context, what is the system in which it exists or happens?  Your evolution timeline should help with explaining this.
