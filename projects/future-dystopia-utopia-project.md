## Future Dystopia / Utopia Project

_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

Imagine our civilization _at least_ 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population.

* What does your imagined future look, sound, and feel like? \(your framing **story**\)
* What **message** would you transmit to the current population from the future? 
* You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build **physical prototypes of an object\(s\)** from your imagined future.
* You will deliver your message in any final **medium\(s\)** you choose. The only requirement is that it includes image\(s\), physical or virtual model\(s\), or video\(s\) of your prototyped physical object\(s\).

I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

* Animals
* Commerce
* Education
* Engineering
* Ethics
* Information
* Materiality
* Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
* Memory
* Nature
* Networks
* Ruins
* Science
* Sexuality
* Systems
* The Object
* Technology
* Time
