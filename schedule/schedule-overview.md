## Schedule

Gitbook is the official source for all dates and assignments; the syllabus is NOT. The syllabus provides a general overview and guideline for the course. The website is a living, dynamic document. Active learning requires flexibility and the investigation of unforeseen paths which may diverge from the specifics outlined below.

**All dates and assignments are subject to change at the discretion of the professor! Gitbook is the official source for all dates and assignments.**

_Gitbook is a living, dynamic source. If there are any changes to the schedule in the syllabus, I will note these changes on gitbook AND in person during class._

OPTIONAL: **Get Training at **[**Tandon's MakerSpace.**](https://wp.nyu.edu/makerspace/training-calendar/)
